This repository demonstrates a common Scala error involving mutable state and exception handling. The `bug.scala` file shows the original code with the error, while `bugSolution.scala` provides an improved version. The error involves using a private var for mutable state in `MyClass`, which is susceptible to exceptions if not properly handled. The solution illustrates a better way to manage state immutability using vals or case classes, and includes more robust exception handling.
